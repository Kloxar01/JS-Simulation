In this project I tried to simulate a life of kingdom that consists of citizens, killer and king. With each passing day citizens either die or multiply depending on population in their "region" (surrounding area).
If there are too many citizens they start diyng. If there are too little citizens they die because they cannot reproduce. Each citizen loves their king, therefore, they will try to stop a killer by sacrificing themselves.
Unfortunately, one citizen is not enough to stop a killer. Enjoy the great king assasination!
